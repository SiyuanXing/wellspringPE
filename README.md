Introduction
	There are many train lines in the city of Chicago. The El is the quickest, the Metra is used to and from the suburbs, and the Amtrak crosses large distances. Your assignment is to write a program that reads in a ‘comma separated values’ (CSV) file containing train information for the various train lines and outputs the train information to the user.

		○ Route Name (ie. Brown Line)

	● The first row of the CSV will always contain the name detailing the field for the information represented
	● Each line of the CSV will be denoted with a combination of a new line character and carriage return: \r\n
