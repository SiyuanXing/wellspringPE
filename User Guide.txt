Introduction of my Project:

This project mainly use HTML+JS+CSS, connect with SQLite databases base on HTML5 technology. I don’t use traditional SQL Database because of the use cannot use it if I create a local database server. And I don’t have a real server to work for this project. And SQLite is a stand-alone database and store the data in your browser(Chrome, Safari, IE) by a local db file. So anyone can use the database I created.

Tips of using my project:

1. Click “index.html” to open it in ./Source Code/wellspringPE/

2. Loading a CSV file in local drive to insert multiple data.(Part1)

3. Insert one record into database by typing the value.(Part2)

4. Read tables in database, list all the data and sort by RUN_NUMBER.(Part3)

5. Choose one row from Part3, update the information by input the value. You can change any column you want. Keep the block empty means don’t change this value.

6. Choose one row from Part3, and delete it.
